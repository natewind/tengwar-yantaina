# Tengwar Yantaina

This is a modification of Tengwar Sindarin by Daniel Smith that utilizes OpenType substitutions to automate transcription in the [Classical Mode](http://www.at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_quenya.htm).

## Tips

* S is always denoted by *silme*, since there’s obviously no way for a font to understand etymology. If you want *súle* instead, you have to spell out TH.
* *Noldo* is not used anywhere by default, for the reason above and because no Classical Mode samples of it are known. Type Ñ if you want it.
* To denote duodecimal 10 and 11, J and Z are used, since they’re the only Latin letters that never appear in (Noldorin) Quenya.
* You don’t need to change text direction for numbers: it’s done automatically via directional marks.

## TODO: Capital letters

* [ ] **Figure out how to copy glyphs to another font with TrueType instructions**
* [ ] Alternative: Use a separate fallback font
* [ ] **Create *tehtar* variations for capital letters**
* [ ] Implement capitalization (add glyphs, edit substitutions)

If anyone knows how to solve the copying issue or is willing to create the *tehtar* variations, please message me!
